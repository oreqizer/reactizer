# Folder structure

All files should have a `__tests__` folder next to them, with a `<filename>.spec.ts` test.

## Components

Contains _components_.

> Sub-components can go only one level deep. Sub-components cannot have nested sub-components.

```
components/
  MyComponent/
    index.tsx <- The main component, only this is allowed to be imported
    components/
      SubComponent/
        index.tsx <- A component used in 'index.tsx' or other subcomponents
    services/
      getName.ts <- A component's mini service
```

**Can have**

- subcomponents
- consts
- records
- services

**Cannot have**

## Consts

Contains _constants_. Prefer granular exporting than one huge blob. Utilize **TS** `enum` type.

```

    cookies.ts <- Keys used for storing cookies
```

## Records

Contains _data types_ and _functions_ operating on the data type.

```

    Kek.ts <- A record with its functions
```

**Example:**

```js
export type Kek = {
  bur: string,
};

export const wrapBur = (str: string, kek: Kek) => str + kek.bur + str;
```
